This course will serve as a basic introduction to the field of parallel computing. Emphasis will be on the fundamental 
principles for parallel algorithm design and analysis, and parallel programming for distributed and shared memory parallel 
machines. Topics to be covered (not necessarily in order) include (but not limited to):

1. Fundamentals in parallel algorithm design and analysis
2. Parallel computation models
3. Network intraconnects and embeddings
4. MPI programming
5. OpenMP shared memory multicore programming
6. Parallel reduction operations
7. Parallel prefix
8. Sorting
9. Matrix operations
10. Parallel scientific computing applications
11. MapReduce and cloud computing
